    <i>First of all, the university was a complete joke.
          Big mistake by me to go there. While it is true, that if you want
          to learn, you can learn, but it's also true, that they don't do
          anything to make it easier for you, despite the fact, that the taxes
          were the highest in Bulgaria at that time. At the end of the second
          year, I started working for
          <a href="http://4xchange.bg/?lang=en" target="_blank">TopChange</a>
          (The biggest foreign currency exchange company in Bulgaria at
          that time)
          and at the end of the summer,
          they offered me to go to
          <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bansko"  target="_blank">
          Bansko</a>, working as
          Assistant Regional Manager for the winter season. The idea was to be
          teached and prepared for the next summer season, and work as
          a Regional Manager. So I had a decision to make.
          Should I stay at the university and learn nothing
          or pause it for a year and learn from the best. I went to
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bansko"  target="_blank">Bansko</a>,
          where the company had 12 offices and 40 people
          working there. During the summer season, I was Regional Manager at
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints_Constantine_and_Helena,_Bulgaria"  target="_blank">
          Saints Constantine and Helena</a>, where the company had
          6 offices and 17 people. The whole scenario repeat again, with a little
          difference - the next summer I was Assistent Regional Manager at
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Sands"  target="_blank">Golden Sands</a>
          - 60 offices and around 200 people (while working there,
          the pressure I was under, and decision making I had to make, have been
          the hardest and most impactful in my entire life up until this point).
          Then, I resumed the education and lost (LOST) a whole year, seeing
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dluwVks444" target="_blank"><b>how people teach you what to think, not how to think</b></a> (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb_bTUJp39o" target="_blank">this</a> as well). For me,
          this is a huge problem (and mistake), so in September 2011,
          (after one more season at
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Sands"  target="_blank">Golden Sands</a>
          )
          I paused again, and at 2012 I officially quit, due to the fact,
          that my paradigm for teaching and learning differ with the established one. I quit the university and start
          spending my time on programming. This was and still is the best choice in my life.</i>
