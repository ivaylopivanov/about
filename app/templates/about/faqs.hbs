      <p>Any kind, as much as possible.</p>
      <p>From a project's perspective, I'll need to know how you want / don't want the product to look like / to work. I'll need any details You can provide and depending on the project - a fallback plan, if You have one.</p>
      <p>From a job's perspective, I would like to know the team - how much experience they have, concentrations (fron-end, back-end, full stack), projects, programming languages, github profiles, which developing methodologies and deployment strategies they use. These things are important to me. Although I'm the senior at E-Motive, I'll consider a job offer only if the company has at least two senior developers with enough big projects in their portfolio, so I can be the mid level dev, learning from them. In other words, the most important thing for me is to work with people from whom I can learn - not the money.</p>
