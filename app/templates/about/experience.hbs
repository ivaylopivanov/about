          E-Motive is an experienced e-commerce solution provider,
          specialised in helping brands to partner with online marketplaces.
          Depending on the case, I determine the roadmap, how to innovate,
          synchronizing departments and of course - developing, using the
          appropriate language(s) and technology.
          I have experience working on both very simple projects, as well as vast and comples ones, needing integration with
          Amazon, eBay, other 3rd party APIs, and syncs between more than
          one e-commerce platform at the same time.

          <p>          As one of the best established Russian IT companies,
          IQ has many clients. I was responsible for maintaining old and
          delivering new products for our clients.
          Unfortunately, just after several weeks,
          I realized, that the company methods and technologies for
          delivering products are not helping me to develop myself.</p>
